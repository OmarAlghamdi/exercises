Problem description:

Given the position of two pieces on a chess board, indicate where they can move to and whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.

A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.
So if, for example, you're told the white queen is at D3 and the black queen at G6, then you'd know you've got a set-up like so:

1_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
2_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
3_ _ _ W _ _ _ _
4_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
5_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
6_ _ _ _ _ _ B _
7_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
8_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 A B C D E F G H

You'd also be able to answer whether the queens can attack each other. In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.

Input:
{
  white: {
           type: rook,
           position: 'D3'
         },
  black: {
           type: knight,
           position: 'G6'
         }
}

Output:
{
  whiteMoves: ['H7', ...],
  blackMoves: ['G2', ...],
  canWhiteAttack: true,
  canBlackAttack: false
}

Bonus:
save input and output with date and time in mongoDB
